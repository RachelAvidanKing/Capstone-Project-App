This is the Capstone Project for Rachel Avidan-King and Daniel Shahar's Software Engineering degree. No commercial use is intended, this is a public repository purley for ease of our professors' grading.


ARCHIVED: This branch contains legacy history before the refactoring of the whole project to create three distinct directories for Kotlin/Python/React. DO NOT MERGE.
